# Dashboards and Promtimer

One of the goals of Promtimer is to make it quick and easy to add useful Grafana dashboards and
graphs. The dashboard "meta model" is Promtimer's attempt to do this. To explain how Promtimer
dashboarding works it's necessary to understand a little about how Grafana dashboarding works.
However, if you're already comfortable with that, or you just want to proceed to creating your
first Promtimer dashboard by example, feel free to skip to step 2.
