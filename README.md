# Promtimer

In 7.0, Couchbase Server has moved to use Prometheus as the storage backend
for stats and when logs are collected, a Prometheus snapshot is generated
and included in the zip archive. Promtimer is a tool that uses Prometheus
itself and Grafana to allow easy, powerful browsing of Prometheus metrics
(stats) available in cbcollects.

If you've already installed, here are a some quick links you might be
interested in:
* [Dashboards README](dashboards/README.md)
* [Todos](TODO.md)

## Idea
Promtimer:

1. Starts a Prometheus server for each of the cbcollects you are interested
   in exploring
1. Generates a convenient Grafana configuration with
   anonymous login, a custom home dashboard, data sources and dashboards
1. Starts Grafana allowing you to login and browse dashboards that collect
   metrics from across each node in the cluster
1. Optionally creates annotations based on important events that happened in
   the cbcollect, taking information from events.log generated by the Event Logger

## Dependencies

You will need:

* A Prometheus binary (version 2.20 or later)
* Grafana (version 7.1 or later)
* Promtimer
* Some cbcollects
* (Optional) Event Logger from [cbmultimanager](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/cbmultimanager)
  in order to see annotations

If you happen to be building Couchbase Server 7.0 or later, you will already 
have a Prometheus binary: it's in the `install/bin` directory of one of your 
local builds. If you don't, the [Getting Started](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/) 
instructions on the Prometheus website are comprehensive. You don't actually
need to install Prometheus, you just need the binary. [Downloading](https://prometheus.io/download/)
and unzipping the pre-compiled binaries for your platform is sufficient.

If you're on Mac,`brew` is convenient:

    brew install prometheus

It's also possible to build Prometheus from source yourself. This is 
straightforward:

```
git clone git@github.com:prometheus/prometheus.git
cd prometheus
make prometheus
```

You'll need a full Grafana install. The `grafana-server` binary alone isn't 
sufficient as Grafana ships with many configuration files. 
[Installation instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) 
on the Grafana website look comprehensive. Follow the instructions for your
platform to get a recent version of Grafana. On Mac, it's easy:

    brew install grafana

To get Promtimer, clone this repo locally:

    git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/promtimer.git

As to cbcollects, you probably wouldn't be reading this if you didn't already
have them. 

## How to Use Promtimer

Assemble the cbcollects in a directory and unzip them. 

```
ls collectinfo*.zip | xargs -n 1 unzip
```

Start Promtimer:

```
bin/promtimer [--prometheus <path-to-prometheus-binary>]
     [--grafana-home <path-to-grafana-shared-config-home>]
```

The `path-to-prometheus-binary` specifies the path to the prometheus binary and
must be specified if the binary you wish to use isn't on your PATH.

The `path-to-grafana-shared-config-home` is what is known in Grafana terminology as the
"homepath". This is the out-of-the-box Grafana shared config path. On brew-installed
Grafana on Macs this is something like:

    /usr/local/share/grafana

On linux systems the homepath should usually be:

    /usr/share/grafana

Promtimer defaults the Grafana homepath to these locations on these platforms. However,
if you're on a different platform or want to use a different homepath you'll need to
explicitly specify it.

The Grafana dashboards page should open for you automatically. If not, navigate
to `localhost:13300/dashboards` in your browser and begin exploring the
available dashboards.

## Annotations from System Events

As an option, Promtimer supports the generation of Grafana annotations for system events
(such as rebalance start & stop). To use this function currently you need to have access
to the [cbmultimanager](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/cbmultimanager) repository.
Don't worry if you don't have access to this repo, Promtimer will work fine without the
annotations.

Read [here](EVENTS.md) for information on how to annotations for system events into
Promtimer graphs.

## Clean Up

Promtimer creates a `.promtimer` sub-directory in the directory where it's
started and places the Grafana configuration. To clean up, remove this
directory:

```
rm -rf .promtimer
```
